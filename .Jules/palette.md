## 2024-05-22 - Missing info due to early returns
**Learning:** Found a case where CLI output was skipping important info (Token Usage) due to an early `return` in an empty state check (no recent tasks).
**Action:** Replaced early return with `if/else` block to ensure all sections are printed even when some data is empty.
